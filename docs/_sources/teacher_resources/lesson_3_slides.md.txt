- how to use coordinates to move the turtle
- how to move the turtle without drawing a line

---

## Part 1

*Variables*

---

### Conventional range

How to use `range` in a more conventual way.

Previously, we would use the following code to print four numbers.

``` python
for index in range(1, 5):
    print(number)
```

> **What is index?**
> 
> `index` &rarr; programming convention that represents a counter in a loop

---

If you run the code you get the following.

```
1
2
3
4
```

---

Only concerned about the number of iterations

``` python
for index in range(0, 4):
    print(number)
```

Will produce:

```
0
1
2
3
```

Still has four iterations &rarr; starts counting at `0`

---

If `range` function not given a starting number &rarr; start at `0`

``` python
for index in range(4):
    print(number)
```

Will produce:

```
0
1
2
3
```

The way that `range` is conventionally used.

---

### Replace magic numbers

**A** solution for lesson 2 exercise 1

New file **lesson_3_pt_1.py** &rarr; enter the code

``` python
import turtle

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(4):
    my_ttl.forward(100)
    my_ttl.left(90)
```

Draw a triangle with side length `200` &rarr; what do we need to change?

---

``` python
import turtle

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(3):
    my_ttl.forward(200)
    my_ttl.left(120)
```

What do the changed numbers represent?

- `4` &rarr; `3` representing the number sides.
- `100` &rarr; `200` representing the length of the sides.
- `90` &rarr; `120` representing the degrees the Turtle has to turn.

To draw a hexagon &rarr; same three numbers change

---

These numbers &rarr; **magic numbers**

A magic number &rarr; **hard coded** value in the program

Magic numbers &rarr; not good

- No explicit meaning &rarr; what do `3`, `200` and `120` mean? 
- Changing 1000 squares into triangles &rarr; 3000 edits.

---

Replace magic numbers with labels called **variables**

``` python
import turtle

sides = 3
length = 200
degrees = 120

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(degrees)
```

- **Predict** and **run** the code
- `sides`, `length` and `degrees` are all **variables** &rarr; let's **investigate**

---

![flowchart lesson 3 1](../assets/flowchart_lesson_3_1.png)

---

- `sides = 3` creates variable `sides` &rarr; assigns `3` to it
- `length = 200` creates variable `length` &rarr; assigns `200` to it
- `degress = 120` creates the variable `degrees` &rarr; assigns `120` to it
- `for i in range(sides):` substitutes `sides` with `3` &rarr; `for index in range(3)`
- `my_ttl.forward(length)` substitutes `length` with `200` &rarr; `my_ttl.forward(200)`
- `my_ttl.left(degrees)` substitutes `degrees` with `120` &rarr; `my_ttl.left(120)`

---

### Python naming rules

Very specific rules variable names:

- can only contain letters, numbers and the `_` character
- cannot contain spaces
- cannot start with a number
- are case sensitive (eg. `age` is not the same as `Age`)

---

Using variables &rarr; copy the `for` loop as many times as we want

Values for `sides`, `length`, and `degrees` &rarr; use the values assigned to them

**Single point of truth**

Changing the value of `sides` &rarr; changes the value for uses of `sides`

Same for `length` and `degrees`.

Change **lesson_3_pt_1.py**  to draws a hexagon with length of 100

---

``` python
import turtle

sides = 6
length = 100
degrees = 60

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(degrees)
```

---

### No 'meat space' calculations

How did we know that degrees needed to be 60?

Worked it out in your head or used a calculator?

Flaws on both:

- head calculations can be incorrect
- getting a calculator is a waste of time

Use Python to do the calculations.

---

### Python Arithmetic Operators

| Operation | Symbol |
| --------- | :----: |
| Addition | + |
| Subtraction | - |
| Multiplication | * |
| Division | / |
| Modulus | % |
| Exponentiation | ** |
| Floor Division | // |

---

Degrees is `360` divided by number of sides (`sides`)

In code &rarr; `degrees = 360 / sides`

``` python
import turtle

sides = 6
length = 100
degrees = 360 / sides

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(degrees)
```

---

### Remove unnecessary variables

Do we need the `degrees` variable?

Could place calculation inside the `for` loop.

``` python
import turtle

sides = 6
length = 100

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(500, 500)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(360 / sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(degrees)
```

Are there any more **magic numbers**? See if you can find any more.

---

``` python
import turtle

screen = 500
sides = 6
length = 100
CIRCLE_DEG = 360

window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(screen, screen)
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()

for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(DEGREES_IN_CIRCLE / sides)
```

`CIRCLE_DEG` is a **constants**  &rarr; its value will never change

Python's naming conventions &rarr; capitalise constants.

---

### Naming conventions

Naming conventions &rarr; make code easier to understand.

- Use descriptive names that explains the value stored in them
  - `d = 30` &rarr; bad
  - `degrees = 30` &rarr; better
  - `degrees_celsius = 30` &rarr; best
- Use snake case for multiple word names:
  - replace the spaces with the `_` character
  - only use lower case letters
  - `this_is_snake_case`
- CAPTIALIZE names of constants (variables whose value will not change)
- Do not use the names of keywords (eg. `print`, `for`, etc)

### Maintainability

![XKCD Code Quality](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png)

**Maintainability** &rarr; how easy your code is to understand for other programmers

---

To improve maintainability &rarr; structure code

- group code under their functionality (what they do)
- use comments to signpost this functionality

---

``` python
import turtle

# set up screen
screen = 500
window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(screen, screen)

# create turtle instance
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()
my_ttl.shape("arrow")

# shape parameters
sides = 6
length = 100
DEGREES_IN_CIRCLE = 360

# draw the shape
for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(DEGREES_IN_CIRCLE / sides)
```

---

People reading the program will know the code that:

- sets up the screen
- creates the turtle instance
- defines the shape parameters
- draws the shape

Save the file as **lesson_3_pt_2.py** (**File** &rarr;Â **Save as...**).

---

### How Turtle coordinates work

Like piece of graph paper measured in pixels 500px wide and 500px high 

![coordinates](../assets/coordinates.png)

---

- the centre of the screen &rarr; origin of `(0,0)`
- moving up from centre &rarr; `y` value increases to max `250`
- moving down from centre &rarr; `y` value decreases to min `-250`
- moving left from centre &rarr; `x` increases to max `250`
- moving right starting from centre &rarr; `x` decreases to min `-250`
- coordinate &rarr; `x` and `y` value for a pixel
  - coordinates represented as a tuple of `(x, y)`
  - For example `(200,125)`

---

### What's a tuple?

`(500,500)` &rarr; **tuple**

Like a list but can't change the values &rarr; **immutable**

Tuples:

- start with `(`
- end with `)`
- `,` separates the elements

---

### Using `goto`

``` python
import turtle

# set up screen
screen = 500
window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(screen, screen)

# create turtle instance
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()
my_ttl.shape("arrow")

# shape parameters
sides = 6
length = 100

my_ttl.goto(0, 125)

# draw shape
# for index in range(sides):
#    my_ttl.forward(length)
#    my_ttl.left(360 / sides)
```

---

### Investigate

- `my_ttl.goto(0,125)` &rarr; turtle move to position `x = 0` and `y = 125`.
  
- `#` &rarr; turns the code into comments
  - called **commenting out** code &rarr; useful for debugging
  
**Modify** the code &rarr; moves to all points in coordinates diagram

---

``` python
import turtle

# set up screen
screen = 500
window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(screen, screen)

# create turtle instance
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()
my_ttl.shape("arrow")

# draw boarder
my_ttl.goto(240, 240)
my_ttl.goto(-240, 240)
my_ttl.goto(-240, -240)
my_ttl.goto(240, -240)
my_ttl.goto(240, 240)
my_ttl.goto(0, 0)
```

---

``` python
# shape parameters
sides = 6
length = 100

# draw shape
for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(360 / sides)
```

- **Predict** then **run** the code
  - Did it do what you predicted?
- **Investigate** the code by changing it

---

### Using `penup` and `pendown`

Use `penup` and `pendown` function to remove annoying line

![coordinates](../assets/penup.png)

---

``` python
import turtle

# set up screen
screen = 500
window = turtle.Screen()
window.setup(screen, screen)

# create turtle instance
my_ttl = turtle.Turtle()
my_ttl.shape("arrow")

# draw boarder
my_ttl.penup()
my_ttl.goto(240, 240)
my_ttl.pendown()
my_ttl.goto(-240, 240)
my_ttl.goto(-240, -240)
my_ttl.goto(240, -240)
my_ttl.pen(up)
my_ttl.goto(0, 0)
my_ttle.pendown()
```

---

``` python
# shape parameters
sides = 6
length = 100

# draw shape
for index in range(sides):
    my_ttl.forward(length)
    my_ttl.left(360 / sides)
```

**Predict** what you think will happen, then **run** the code
