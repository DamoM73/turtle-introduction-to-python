# Introduction for Teachers

I created this site for use with my secondary school students. It started with resources and examples from other teachers, so I also present this for other teachers to use.

This site supports my classroom practice by addressing two issues:

- the divergence of my students' coding experience entering into this introductory unit
- regular and extended absences during the Covid 19 pandemic

My pedagogical approach is thus:

- Students are presented with the website and are invited to proceed at their own pace.
  - This allows students to race ahead if they wish.
  - I have included a page with links to additional tutorials, for those students who finish before the class.
- I live code the content with the class.
  - This represents the minimum progress I expect from students
  - If they are behind what I am doing in class, they need to catch up.
- If students fall behind, they can catch up via this site.

Each of the six lessons consist of two parts. Each part should take approximately one hour to complete.
